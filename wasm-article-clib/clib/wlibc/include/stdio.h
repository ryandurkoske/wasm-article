Single file sprintf replacement.

Originally written by Jeff Roberts at RAD Game Tools - 2015/10/20.
Hereby placed in public domain.

This is a full sprintf replacement that supports everything that
the C runtime sprintfs support, including float/double, 64-bit integers,
hex floats, field parameters (%*.*d stuff), length reads backs, etc.

Why would you need this if sprintf already exists?  Well, first off,
it's *much* faster (see below). It's also much smaller than the CRT
versions code-space-wise. We've also added some simple improvements
that are super handy (commas in thousands, callbacks at buffer full,
for example). Finally, the format strings for MSVC and GCC differ
for 64-bit integers (among other small things), so this lets you use
the same format strings in cross platform code.

It uses the standard single file trick of being both the header file
and the source itself. If you just include it normally, you just get
the header file function definitions. To get the code, you include
it from a C or C++ file and define STB_SPRINTF_IMPLEMENTATION first.

It only uses va_args macros from the C runtime to do it's work. It
does cast doubles to S64s and shifts and divides U64s, which does
drag in CRT code on most platforms.

It compiles to roughly 8K with float support, and 4K without.
As a comparison, when using MSVC static libs, calling sprintf drags
in 16K.

API:
====
int stbsp_sprintf( char * buf, char const * fmt, ... )
int stbsp_snprintf( char * buf, int count, char const * fmt, ... )
  Convert an arg list into a buffer.  stbsp_snprintf always returns
  a zero-terminated string (unlike regular snprintf).

int stbsp_vsprintf( char * buf, char const * fmt, va_list va )
int stbsp_vsnprintf( char * buf, int count, char const * fmt, va_list va )
  Convert a va_list arg list into a buffer.  stbsp_vsnprintf always returns
  a zero-terminated string (unlike regular snprintf).

int stbsp_vsprintfcb( vsprintf_cp * callback, void * user, char * buf, char const * fmt, va_list va )
    typedef char * vsprintf_cp( char const * buf, void * user, int len );
  Convert into a buffer, calling back every STB_SPRINTF_MIN chars.
  Your callback can then copy the chars out, print them or whatever.
  This function is actually the workhorse for everything else.
  The buffer you pass in must hold at least STB_SPRINTF_MIN characters.
    // you return the next buffer to use or 0 to stop converting

void stbsp_set_separators( char comma, char period )
  Set the comma and period characters to use.

FLOATS/DOUBLES:
===============
This code uses a internal float->ascii conversion method that uses
doubles with error correction (double-doubles, for ~105 bits of
precision).  This conversion is round-trip perfect - that is, an atof
of the values output here will give you the bit-exact double back.

One difference is that our insignificant digits will be different than
with MSVC or GCC (but they don't match each other either).  We also
don't attempt to find the minimum length matching float (pre-MSVC15
doesn't either).

If you don't need float or doubles at all, define WLIBC_SPRINTF_NOFLOAT
and you'll save 4K of code space.

64-BIT INTS:
============
This library also supports 64-bit integers and you can use MSVC style or
GCC style indicators (%I64d or %lld).  It supports the C99 specifiers
for size_t and ptr_diff_t (%jd %zd) as well.

EXTRAS:
=======
Like some GCCs, for integers and floats, you can use a ' (single quote)
specifier and commas will be inserted on the thousands: "%'d" on 12345
would print 12,345.

For integers and floats, you can use a "$" specifier and the number
will be converted to float and then divided to get kilo, mega, giga or
tera and then printed, so "%$d" 1000 is "1.0 k", "%$.2d" 2536000 is
"2.53 M", etc. For byte values, use two $:s, like "%$$d" to turn
2536000 to "2.42 Mi". If you prefer JEDEC suffixes to SI ones, use three
$:s: "%$$$d" -> "2.42 M". To remove the space between the number and the
suffix, add "_" specifier: "%_$d" -> "2.53M".

In addition to octal and hexadecimal conversions, you can print
integers in binary: "%b" for 256 would print 100.

PERFORMANCE vs MSVC 2008 32-/64-bit (GCC is even slower than MSVC):
===================================================================
"%d" across all 32-bit ints (4.8x/4.0x faster than 32-/64-bit MSVC)
"%24d" across all 32-bit ints (4.5x/4.2x faster)
"%x" across all 32-bit ints (4.5x/3.8x faster)
"%08x" across all 32-bit ints (4.3x/3.8x faster)
"%f" across e-10 to e+10 floats (7.3x/6.0x faster)
"%e" across e-10 to e+10 floats (8.1x/6.0x faster)
"%g" across e-10 to e+10 floats (10.0x/7.1x faster)
"%f" for values near e-300 (7.9x/6.5x faster)
"%f" for values near e+300 (10.0x/9.1x faster)
"%e" for values near e-300 (10.1x/7.0x faster)
"%e" for values near e+300 (9.2x/6.0x faster)
"%.320f" for values near e-300 (12.6x/11.2x faster)
"%a" for random values (8.6x/4.3x faster)
"%I64d" for 64-bits with 32-bit values (4.8x/3.4x faster)
"%I64d" for 64-bits > 32-bit values (4.9x/5.5x faster)
"%s%s%s" for 64 char strings (7.1x/7.3x faster)
"...512 char string..." ( 35.0x/32.5x faster!)
